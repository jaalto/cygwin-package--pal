-Generates a HTML calendar suitable for display on a web page.  It does not generate a complete HTML document so that you can add your website's header and footer around the calendar.  The number of months shown on the calendar can be adjusted with \fB-c\fR.  You will need to use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to change how the calendar appears---if you do not use a style sheet, the calendar will not have any borders.  See \fI/usr/share/doc/pal-#.#.#/example.css\fR for an example style.  SECURITY NOTE: If you set up pal so it is being executed server-side, it is recommended that you do not allow web page visitors to directly change the parameters sent to pal.  Allowing users to pass strange parameters (such as extremely long ones) can be a security risk.
